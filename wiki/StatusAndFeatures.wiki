  * they're on the [http://code.google.com/p/fbclient/issues/list issue tracker].

    * `CREATE DATABASE` command
    * attachment options
       * force trusted authentication (fb 2.0+)

      * db creation date (fb 2.0+)
      * list of active transactions (fb 1.5+)
      * get raw contents of any database page (fb 2.5+)
    * asynchronous request cancellation (fb 2.5+)
  * transactions:

    * segmented blobs and blob streams
      * blob filters (untested, see todo below)
      * blob info function
  * service manager API:
    * attachment options:
       * force trusted authentication (fb 2.0+)
    * server info (version, capabilities, list of connected databases)
    * get server's logfile contents
    * get statistics about a database (gstat functionality)
      * gstat'ing only one table (not implemented yet, see todo below)
    * full backup & restore (gbak functionality)
    * incremental backup & restore (nbackup functionality; fb 2.5+) 
    * database check, repair, sweep, mend, set header fileds (gfix functionality)

    * `RDB$ADMIN` role mapping (fb 2.5+)
  * error API
    * support for sqlcode, sqlcode interpretation and error traceback
    * updated list of isc error messages to help in case of missing `firebird.msg`

== Todo List ==

  === next version ===
  * 64bit x86 linux port (will work with the next version of alien)
  * schema (metadata) class with DDL generation and schema comparison between two databases, and an SQL data export function
  * [http://code.google.com/p/fbtrace/ fbtrace], a GUI frontend for the tracing API
  * standardization: change all sources tab size to 3 spaces, no tabs
  * standardization: change all class names to camel case (I hate camel case) 

  === long term (as it goes) ===
  * events support: needs an asynchronous callback library or making a C module
  * implement user-described xsqlvars for parametrized dsql_execute_immediate(), db_create_sql() and tr_start_sql()
  * test db_cancel_operation()
  * bind and test fb_shutdown() and fb_shutdown_callback()

  ==== portability ====
  * support LUA_NUMBER types int64, int32, float
  * support the LNUM patch in mode LNUM_INT64
  * port/test on big endian platforms

  ==== features of rare usage, obscure or obsolete ====
  * arrays (anyone use them?)
  * blob filters (anyone use them?)
  * ancient dialects 1 and 2 (anyone still using those?)
  * test with Firebird 1.5 (you really should upgrade)
  * research, document and test following obscure tags:
    * SPB: `isc_spb_sts_table, isc_spb_res_length, isc_spb_bkp_expand`
    * BPB: `isc_bpb_filter_parameter, isc_bpb_source_type, isc_bpb_target_type, isc_bpb_source_interp, isc_bpb_target_interp`
    * DB_INFO: `isc_info_set_page_buffers, isc_info_db_file_size`
    * SQL_INFO: `isc_info_sql_select, isc_info_sql_bind, isc_info_sql_num_variables, isc_info_sql_describe_vars`, full list unknown.
  * test limbo transactions: service manager (list & repair), DB_INFO (list), TPB (ignore_limbo, no_auto_undo)
  * decode the status vector
  * marinate neptunian slug for dinner
  * kill all humans

  ==== facilities above the driver ====
  * named parameters -- firebird should provide this (requires sql parsing)
  * batch scripts -- firebird should provide this (requires sql parsing)
  * parsing of SQL plan text to tree structure (format not standardized)
  * parsing the log file contents to table
  * parsing the db_stats text dump to table
  * parsing the database version string to table
